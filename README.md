This is a simple console game called "Guess a Number".  The computer chooses a random number and your job is to guess it!
 In this game your goal is to guess the randomly selected number by your enemy (the computer). There are 3 levels:
> 1️⃣ The First one (1 - 100); 
> 2️⃣ The Second one (1 - 200); 
> 3️⃣ The Third one (1-300). 
In order to complete the game you must beat all three levels. Good Luck! 

Here are some examples of the gameplay:

I used function and conditional statements to create it. I also used Interface on nodejs

Input and Output:
You play by entering a number (For example 3) and then pressing the button 
 >Enter
 >(on your keyboard)

The computer will decide if it is too high / or too low or the right number. 😀
